            <h4>Review:</h4>
<p>Watching Interstellar was nothing short of an extraordinary journey that left me in awe long after the credits rolled. Directed by Christopher Nolan, this film transcends the boundaries of conventional cinema, taking us on a profound voyage through space and time that is as visually stunning as it is intellectually stimulating.</p>
    <p>From the moment Interstellar begins, you are thrust into a future Earth on the brink of ecological collapse. The desperation and urgency are palpable, setting the stage for an epic quest to save humanity. What struck me immediately was the film's ability to blend grandiose science fiction with deeply personal storytelling. The relationship between Cooper, played masterfully by Matthew McConaughey, and his daughter Murph is the emotional heart of the film, grounding the cosmic adventure in a relatable human experience.</p>

        <h3>Pacific Rim</h3>

            <h4>Review:</h4>
<p>The concept about humanity unites to create the Jaegers, gigantic humanoid mechas, each controlled by two co-pilots whose minds are joined by a mental link to defeat the Kaijū, colossal sea monsters is original and creative idea.
    Aboslutely fantastic, amazing visual effects with outstanding robot and monster models and beautiful backgrounds, all thanks to Industrial Light and Magic. This entire movie is a visual spectacle.</p>
    <p>The Jaegers are very exciting and lovable characters, especially Gipsy Danger.
        All of the acting performance are excellently done, such as Charlie Hunnam, Idris Elba, Rinko Kikuchi and Charlie Day, in which they does an outstanding job for playing them. The Kaijū are awesome villains, and they have excellent designs, such as Onibaba, Raiju, Knifehead, Otachi and Slattern! 
        Also the Jaegers have interesting designs mainly meant to identify them individually and are designed after their countries.</p>

        <h3>Ponyo</h3>  
<p>
    Genre: Animation, Comedy, Fantasy, Children's film, Adventure<br />
    Release date: July 19, 2008 <br />

            <p>I don't know what it is about it that gives me so much unbridled joy. Every time I see the giant jellyfish cluster in its opening minutes something just wells up inside of me even in rewatches I still get entranced, ready to melt into my seat and just let the movie wash over me.</p>
            <p>Out of all of the different media I have watched with similar colour pallets and art styles plus visuals Ponyo sticks out to me the most. Granted if a lot of the media I watched had wonderful top tear animation and was directed by the amazing Hayao Miyazaki I'm sure it would be toped but it isn't It remains to be a classic and in a league of its own when it comes to animated classics that pushes what can be told to children and adults alike. overall this is one of the better studio Ghibli films and if you are into animation whatsoever I give this a really big recommendation.</p>
